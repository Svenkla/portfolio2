          <p>
            I am a computer science student with a strong interest in software
            development and full-stack web development. I have hands-on
            experience with various programming languages and enjoy building
            functional and user-friendly web applications. I have already
            completed several personal projects, which you can find on my
            portfolio (Projects).
